 Learning RL by training AI on the snake game
# Motivation
 Beating the game with the help of AI has always fascinated me and this repo is my try at learning reinforcement learning on a simple snake game.
 The code is done with the help of <a href="https://youtu.be/L8ypSXwyBds?si=1sWLTEqr_7FtEomc">Python + PyTorch + Pygame Reinforcement Learning â€“ Train an AI to Play Snake</a> by freecodecamp

 # Results
 After about 180 games the AI produced a maximum score of 68.<br> And after about 150 games the AI consistently scored 15+ in its trials.
